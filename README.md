##How to install Chrome extensions manually
Download the ZIP file or clone your computer for this Chrome extension
Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
Use a ZIP Extractor app -- I used WINRAR -- to unpack the ZIP file and turn it into a folder.
Go back to the chrome://extensions/ page and click the Load unpacked extension button and select the unzipped folder for your extension to install it.
